Game Mechanic:
Players should go through all checkpoints(rings) in a limited time in order to win the game.


Lily's commits
1. add several jump ramps which come with two or three checkpoints
2. change checkpoints' bounse time

The template sets the loop track as the default court and the players can't go over this range. However, I found that the players can fly over the default track through jump ramps so I enabled another track to the game court. Players can only switch the tracks through jump ramps because there are fences on both sides of the track. It becomes more tricky so players are no longer pass the game easily.
